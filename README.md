# A ChatGPT Chrome Extension

On my quest to create extensions not filled with bloat, ads, premium subscriptions, and (more) bloat, I have made this!

## Usage

Simply download everything as a zip, unzip it and remember the name. Then go to `chrome://extensions`, enable `developer mode` (hehe), and select `load unpacked.` Select the directory you named when unzipping. Pin the extension if you want.

Then add your OpenAI token (if you're in Hack Club and are using a token from there, make sure you check `Use the Arcade API`) and ðŸ¥³ you're done! Enjoy responsibly!

## What permissions are used for

I take privacy seriously. This extension does not read site contents, nor does it make any request to anywhere except to OpenAI or Arcade's version of it (they provide free tokens to teens, check out their slack by googling hack club and the channel #open-ai-token). The only real permission it needs is to store your token and settings to be used later. No tracking, promise (wouldn't know how to code that anyways :/).

## Todo

This project isn't done yet! Don't count on updates, but write an issue if you (well, even use this) find an issue/feature/whatever!

- [ ] Show user errors (Wrong token, etc)
- [ ] Give ChatGPT the optional context of the site a user is on
- [ ] Save previous messages

- [ ] Create an actual chrome extension page (maybe)
