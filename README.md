# A ChatGPT Chrome Extension

On my quest to create extensions not filled with bloat, ads, premium subscriptions, and bloat, I have made this!

## Usage

Simple download everything as a zip, unzip it in a directory. Then go to chrome://extensions, enable developer mode, and select load unpacked. Select the directory you named when unzipping.

## What permissions are used for

I take privacy seriously. This extension does not read site contents, nor does it make any request to anywhere except to OpenAI or Arcade's version of it (they provide free tokens to teens, check out their slack by googling hack club and the channel #open-ai-token). The only real permission it needed is to store your token and settings to be used later.

## Todo

This project isn't done yet! Don't count on updates, but write an issue if you (well, even use this) find an issue/feature/whatever!

## What I want to get done:

- [ ] Show user errors (Wrong token, etc)
- [ ] Give ChatGPT the optional context of the site a user is on
- [ ] Save previous messages

- [ ] Create an actual chrome extension page?
